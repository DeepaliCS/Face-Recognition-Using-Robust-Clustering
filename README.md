# Face Recognition using the Robust Clustering Algorithm

This project was created as part of my final year project (technical solution) at Brunel University Computer Science undergraduate degree programme (2017-2018). The overall aim of this project was to count as accurately as possible the number of people in an image.

Incorporating an aspect of artificial intelligence was part of the this degree, therefore Dr Stephen Swift, a greatly respected researcher and lecturer in this field, was the supervisor for this project.

The robust clustering strategy was derived from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11875741_1. The technical solution was created using MATLAB and their trained image recognition NN. Previous attempts at reaching the optimal goal for this project include; using image segmentation methods including Otsu, Hough and Watershed.

## Installation

1. Clone repository
2. Have a valid license to run MATLAB
3. Set an image in the file path (image) set in the `MainScript.m` or set a new file path to your image
4. Run `MainScript.m`

## Applications & Potential Contributions

Some practical applications include taking accurate registers within seconds at schools, crowd control at stadiums to avoid situations like the Hillsborough disaster; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster. This technology can also be used in medical/biometric scenarios to count the number of cells etc.
